This project used the Create React App as the basis for initialization.

It consists of a simple news display utilizing Client-Side Routing combined with an external JSON server hosted on Render.com . The news articles used were taken from newsapi.org .  

We use react-router-dom 5.2.0 to tie in with the lessons provided by Flatiron School.
